These spheres are part of Amazon's, of Jeff Bezos', statement on what the future is. Ever since Bezos founded Amazon, it's been about the future. Bookstore of the future. Shopping mall of the future. Supermarket of the future. The future for every customer... and fast! And cheap!

Sometimes, something is labeled cheap but really comes at a significant price. And what is the price of Bezos being in Seattle? What's it cost us?


Our city and the surrounding area have become a haven for the wealthy and a pretty bad place for most anyone else! Thousands of people getting priced out of town! Thousands of homeless!

And what does it cost the company that makes Jeff Bezos the richest person in the world? Bezos’ Amazon, the company valued in billions of dollars? 350k for Jenny Durkan’s winning mayoral campaign. Zero in federal taxes! Not to mention that he makes a point of overworking people throughout King County, but especially in the Amazon warehouses south of Seattle.

Do you want a future where astronomically high rents and housing prices force thousands of people of color out of of Seattle?

Do you want a future where city council members vote against extremely modest corporate taxes?

Do you want a future where a mayoral campaign gets $350k from Amazon and wins?

Do you want a future where Amazon pays zero federal taxes?

Do you want a future where King County has 11,500 homeless people, record numbers of whom die on the streets?

This isn't even the future, this is Seattle today, King County today. We gotta do better!

How about a future where city officials vote in support of working people?

How about a future where we have the biggest Employee Hours Tax on big business?

How about a future where taxes fund affordable housing and homeless services?

How about a future where Jeff Bezos pays his fair share?

A different future is possible, but we have to fight for it! We've fought for 15, blocked the police bunker, and taxed the rich. Now it's time to fight for affordable housing and the funds to make it happen! Let's fight for the future, y'all! Make Bezos pay! Make Amazon pay! Make Bezos pay! Make Amazon pay!
